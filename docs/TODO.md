Based on the refined strategy and your complete IaC setup, here’s a prioritized action plan that aligns your infrastructure with your goal of a robust, professional streaming pipeline:

⸻

1. Finalize the RTMP Relay & Buffering on RPi5-2

Objective:
Ensure that your Nikon and OBSBot feeds are captured, buffered, and restreamed at high quality with minimal latency.

Actions:
	•	Implement or Validate RTMP Ingestion:
– Use your existing Docker Compose setup (or create a dedicated compose file for RPi5-2) with either the nginx-rtmp module or OvenMediaEngine.
– Tune ffmpeg parameters (GOP, keyframe intervals, buffering settings) to preserve resolution and stability.
	•	Test Ingest and Output:
– Push a test stream (e.g., from your Nikon camera or OBSBot) to the RPi5-2 relay and verify the output via HLS or RTMP.
	•	Integrate with OBS:
– Configure your OBS host (laptop) to use the RPi5-2 RTMP/HLS output as a media source.

⸻

2. Validate Mobile RTMP Quality

Objective:
Improve your iOS streaming quality by using a robust local relay.

Actions:
	•	Switch RTMP Apps:
– Transition from the Prism Lens app to either Live:Air Action or Larix Broadcaster.
	•	Stream Through RPi5-2:
– Have your iOS device stream to the local RTMP server on RPi5-2.
– Confirm that the buffered output (now handled by RPi5-2) is high quality before it reaches OBS.
	•	Adjust Transcoding Settings:
– Ensure the ffmpeg filter in your RTMP configuration (in your nginx.conf.template) is optimized for the iOS aspect ratio and resolution.

⸻

3. Migrate Camera Captures to the Pi Relay

Objective:
Consolidate your physical camera feeds so that both your OBSBot and Nikon cameras stream via RPi5-2, ensuring uniform quality and buffering.

Actions:
	•	Configure Inputs on RPi5-2:
– Connect your HDMI/USB capture devices (OBSBot, Nikon) to the Pi and ensure they’re recognized (use your detect-devices.sh for verification).
	•	Update RTMP Ingest Rules:
– Modify your nginx.conf.template (or create a new section) so that these feeds are ingested and buffered correctly.
	•	Test Quality & Stability:
– Run test streams from each camera to verify consistent quality and adjust ffmpeg settings as needed.

⸻

4. Set Up the Overlay Server on RPi5-1

Objective:
Provide dynamic, headless overlay management (e.g., transparent PNG masks, telemetry overlays) that OBS can pull via HTTP.

Actions:
	•	Deploy a Lightweight HTTP Server:
– Use nginx (or a small Node.js/Flask/FastAPI app) on RPi5-1 to serve your overlay assets.
– Store your transparent PNG overlays (e.g., your iPhone border mask) in a dedicated directory.
	•	Automate Overlay Updates:
– Develop simple automation (via Python or Node.js) that can update or switch overlays based on external triggers (for instance, using a REST API endpoint).
	•	Integrate with OBS:
– In OBS, add a Browser Source that points to the overlay server’s URL so that updated overlays are fetched in real time.

⸻

5. Reconfigure OBS Scenes on Your Laptop

Objective:
Make OBS the central compositor that combines buffered feeds and dynamic overlays from your Pi devices.

Actions:
	•	Implement the Proposed Scene Layout:
– Update your OBS scene collections on your laptop (or in your OBS container) to match the refined layout (e.g., 01_Intro, 02_FaceCam_Main, 03_Desk_Overhead, etc.).
	•	Configure Media Sources:
– Point your media sources in OBS to the buffered RTMP/HLS outputs from RPi5-2 and the overlay URLs from RPi5-1.
	•	Test Transitions and Compositions:
– Verify that your composite scenes (like the multi-camera or iPhone demo with masked overlays) display correctly and maintain resolution.

⸻

6. Long-Term Enhancements

Objective:
Automate further and add remote control features for enhanced interactivity and telemetry.

Ideas:
	•	Develop a Web-Based Dashboard:
– Create a dashboard hosted on one of the Pis to control scene changes, overlay selections, and view live telemetry.
	•	Integrate obs-websocket for Dynamic Control:
– Use obs-websocket (with proper authentication) to enable hotkey-like switching, remote commands, and real-time adjustments.
	•	Implement Advanced Telemetry:
– Pull device metrics, streaming quality data, or user interactions to overlay on the stream for technical demos.

⸻

7. Infrastructure as Code Integration

Objective:
Ensure your Docker Compose files, nginx configurations, and entrypoint scripts reflect these changes.

Actions:
	•	Review and Update Docker Compose Files:
– Ensure that services for RTMP relay (RPi5-2), overlay server (RPi5-1), OBS host, and metadata service are correctly networked.
	•	Parameterize Configurations:
– Use environment variables for stream keys, IP addresses, and buffering parameters so that you can adjust settings quickly.
	•	Automate Deployments:
– Set up CI/CD pipelines (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar) to automatically rebuild and deploy containers when configuration changes occur.
