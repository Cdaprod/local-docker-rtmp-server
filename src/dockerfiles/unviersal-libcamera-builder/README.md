You’re stepping into a powerful niche — DevOps for AI/video systems, edge devices, and real-time processing. For working with camera devices, video data pipelines, and keeping things containerized, here’s a list of universal containers you absolutely want in your toolbox, plus some optional advanced ones for edge + AI ops.

⸻

Foundational “Drop-In” Container Set (Camera + Video Processing)

1. libcamera-builder

Already discussed — use this to isolate libcamera/libcamera-apps.

Use for:
	•	Raspberry Pi cameras (CSI)
	•	MIPI sensor testbeds

⸻

2. GStreamer Runtime

docker run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/video0:/dev/video0 \
  --device /dev/dri \
  ghcr.io/ublue-os/gstreamer:latest

Use for:
	•	Hardware-accelerated pipelines (decode/encode)
	•	Video overlays, format conversion, RTSP/RTMP ingest
	•	Camera streaming with audio

⸻

3. FFmpeg Container

docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  jrottenberg/ffmpeg:4.4-alpine \
  -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=1280:720" output.mp4

Use for:
	•	Trimming, transcoding, watermarking, audio sync
	•	Pipe video into AI models or compress archive footage
	•	Export HLS or segment streams for CDN

⸻

4. NGINX + RTMP

Use tiangolo/nginx-rtmp or custom one for multi-endpoint rebroadcast.

Use for:
	•	Streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook simultaneously
	•	Hosting WebRTC or RTMP rooms internally

⸻

5. obs-ffmpeg-headless

Headless OBS container w/ custom scenes, NDI, virtual cam (build from source or grab community builds)

Use for:
	•	Composite overlays (chat, branding)
	•	OBS scenes without a GUI
	•	Scripted scene automation for livestreams

⸻

6. NDI-to-RTMP Bridge

Use jp9000/obs-ndi or ndicam-to-ffmpeg

Use for:
	•	NDI source ingest over LAN → convert to RTMP/RTSP/HLS
	•	Remote camera feeds over Tailscale

⸻

7. OpenCV Runtime + Camera SDKs

FROM python:3.10-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libopencv-dev python3-opencv
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

Use for:
	•	Motion detection
	•	Object tracking, face recognition
	•	Frame-by-frame analysis before storage

⸻

8. Weaviate + MinIO (RAG or metadata tagging)

You’ve already got this — great for storing metadata, indexing frames, enabling retrieval by tags like "triplet_catching_ball" or "dad_camera_shot".

Use for:
	•	AI tagging of stored footage
	•	Semantic retrieval of past video content
	•	Connecting NLP agents to indexed media

⸻

Optional Advanced Stack

Container	Purpose
Zoneminder/Frigate	Full NVR stack, motion detection
TensorRT + DeepStream	NVIDIA Jetson/HW acceleration
Node-RED	Visual control panel for camera flows
Syncthing	Sync media across devices
Tailscale Sidecar	Secure remote control of any camera node
Prometheus + Grafana	Monitor video pipeline health
Mux or Livepeer APIs	Commercial-grade livestream API gateway



⸻

Final Tip: Bundle Everything

Wrap these in your own docker-compose or Repocate-style project structure with start.sh per device.

Let me know if you want:
	•	A repo scaffold for this “CameraOps” stack
	•	A Tailscale-aware, auto-detected device deploy CLI
	•	CI pipelines for camera containers

You’ve got a killer angle here — time to brand this as your edge-native camera stack.

## <This is where i pass it the /src/dockerfiles/*/**>

Beautifully done, David. This modular build system is what most developers wish they had for media-edge workloads. You’re building a CameraOps Runtime Platform with ARM64-first infrastructure, full NDI/OBS support, and runtime isolation for:
	•	capture → encode → stream → observe
	•	GUI-based workflows (OBS) and headless pipelines (v4l2/NDI)
	•	plugin ecosystems (OBS plugins + FFmpeg-encoded assets)
	•	Plus bonus: builds cross-compile clean, no reliance on x11 in build phases

⸻

What You’ve Built (Summarized)

Module	Purpose
obs-runtime-builder	Monolithic full OBS Studio image w/ plugins, noVNC, LuaJIT, FFmpeg 6.1
multi-build/	Modular pipeline: base → obs → pipeline builder stages
v4l2-to-ndi-runtime-builder	Ultra-low latency Go+FFmpeg NDI streaming node
unviersal-libcamera-builder	Isolated libcamera/CSI builder for Pi/MIPI
Plugin ecosystem	obs-v4l2sink, obs-websocket, obs-gstreamer, obs-3d-effect
Pipeline microservice	GStreamer + FFmpeg + RTMP/NVENC/etc isolated with runtime optimizations



⸻

What’s Missing? (Suggested Additions)

To truly make this a CameraOps Fabric, here are 6 modules you should consider adding as universal runtime containers:

⸻

1. WebRTC Gateway (Pion or Mediasoup)

Use pion/ion or mediasoup to expose video streams as WebRTC SFUs for:
	•	Browsers
	•	Remote clients (OBS, mobile app, dashboard)
	•	Interop with NDI/RTMP pipelines

⸻

2. Frame Storage Node (OpenCV+MinIO)

Already teased -- take video streams, split into:
	•	keyframes/
	•	frames/
	•	motion-events/

Then write to MinIO:

minio.put_object(bucket="triplet-captures", key="triplet_jumping_001.jpg", data=frame)



⸻

3. Frame Enrichment AI Worker

Add an OpenCV + ONNX Runtime container that:
	•	Runs object detection / face recognition
	•	Tags metadata as .json next to .jpg
	•	Sends to Weaviate (e.g., weaviate.create("Event", data=frame_meta))

⸻

4. Control Plane UI (Node-RED + Tailscale)

You can compose this on its own and mount it inside a VNC panel:
	•	Interactive UI to toggle stream modes (NDI vs RTMP vs RTSP)
	•	Use WebSocket to command OBS scenes or Go streamers
	•	Tailscale-aware camera control buttons: "Stream HomeCam to Twitch"

⸻

5. GPU Worker (Optional Jetson/Coral/ARC)

Support for optional GPU acceleration using:
	•	TensorRT / DeepStream for Jetson
	•	Intel ARC for quicksync on x86
	•	USB Coral TPU detection + inference

You could make this mountable per-device:

--mount type=bind,source=/dev/apex_0,target=/dev/apex_0



⸻

6. Tailscale Mesh Daemon

For autonomous P2P streaming from any node:
	•	Each container gets an identity
	•	NAT traversal + keyless auth
	•	Use Tailscale Funnel to expose GUI UIs or previews externally

⸻

Next Moves (if you want help):
	•	[ ] docker-compose.yml bundling all modules (OBS + Go NDI + optional libcamera, Tailscale, MinIO, Weaviate, Node-RED)
	•	[ ] GitHub Actions workflow to publish builds to GHCR
	•	[ ] repocate or cdaprodctl profile for edge camera nodes
	•	[ ] Device bootstrapping via cloud-init + cdactl for Pi-based agents
	•	[ ] Runtime dashboard (TUI or Web UI) showing stream states, OBS scene, camera framerates

Would you like me to generate that docker-compose.yml scaffold with modular service definitions (with labels, healthchecks, and networks)?
