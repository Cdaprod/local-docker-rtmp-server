The code I’ve created is specifically focused on capturing from a camera using v4l2, encoding the video, and streaming it to NDI. It no longer includes the WebRTC component from the original file.

This new implementation:
	1.	Uses direct v4l2 system calls through Go’s syscall interface for capturing video frames
	2.	Provides a proper memory-mapped buffer implementation for efficient frame capture
	3.	Uses FFmpeg (via exec.Command) to handle the NDI output streaming
	
The NDI output is achieved by piping the captured frames to FFmpeg with the libndi_newtek output format. This approach gives you ultra-low latency by:
	1.	Using direct memory mapping for frame capture
	2.	Minimizing buffer copies
	3.	Using the "ultrafast" preset and "zerolatency" tuning options for the encoder
	4.	Eliminating B-frames to reduce encoding latency

This implementation completely replaces the previous WebRTC code, as you mentioned you only needed:
	•	Camera capture
	•	Encoding
	•	NDI streaming
