This is an outstanding showcase of a full-stack, container-native control plane architecture.

The metadata-service is unequivocally your event-driven controller--we've built it as:

A Service Control API
	•	FastAPI-driven HTTP endpoints for:
	•	/control/start_service
	•	/control/stop_service
	•	/control/restart_service
	•	Using subprocess calls to docker-compose, scoped via DOCKER_PROJECT_NAME and DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE.
	•	Handles service orchestration dynamically and idempotently.

A Central Event Ingestor
	•	/events/on_publish and /events/on_publish_done receive RTMP events.
	•	Enriches payloads with provenance and timestamps.
	•	Publishes to RabbitMQ queue: stream_events.
	•	Pydantic models and Depends() ensure clean dependency injection for RabbitMQ clients.

A System Health Supervisor
	•	/health performs connectivity checks to:
	•	RabbitMQ
	•	Docker daemon
	•	MinIO
	•	Uses dependency-injected clients for each service.
	•	Returns an overall system readiness status: healthy or degraded.

A Storage Abstraction Layer
	•	/storage routes allow:
	•	File uploads, downloads, and deletions to/from MinIO buckets.
	•	Structured metadata handling with .json formatting and bucket segregation.
	•	Automatically ensures buckets exist (ensure_bucket_exists()).
	•	Optional support for streaming logs or event payloads into object storage.

A LogStream Controller
	•	Singleton LogStreamer class:
	•	Streams real-time container logs via Docker SDK.
	•	Optional callback hooks: stdout, WebSockets, RabbitMQ, or file emitters.
	•	Can be extended easily for:
	•	UI-based live log panels
	•	MinIO archival
	•	Analytics pipelines

In Short: metadata-service = Your Homelab’s Brain

Roles it plays:

Function	Layer	Technology
Service lifecycle manager	Orchestration	Docker Compose, Python Subprocess
RTMP metadata processor	Event ingestion	FastAPI, RabbitMQ
Logging pipeline	Observability/logging	Docker SDK, Python Logger
Health monitoring	Platform reliability	RabbitMQ, Docker, MinIO
File and metadata storage	Object Storage Gateway	MinIO Python SDK
Extensible service agent	Job execution (OBS, Blender)	API routers, modular service interfaces

What You Might Consider Next
	1.	Plugin/Agent Architecture
	•	Allow plugins to register as services and expose control interfaces (restart, status, etc).
	•	Possibly move blender.py and obs.py to a /agents module or namespace.
	2.	WebSocket Layer
	•	Create /ws/logs or /ws/events to stream logs/events to a frontend (dashboard).
	•	Integrate LogStreamer.set_callback() to send log entries in real-time.
	3.	Event Forwarding / ETL Pipelines
	•	Add RabbitMQ consumers for downstream transformations.
	•	E.g., when on_publish is triggered, enrich with GPT and push to analytics_queue.
	4.	Service Registry & Discovery
	•	Keep a registry of running services and their metadata.
	•	Expose /services or /registry endpoints.

This metadata-service is production-grade by design and could evolve into a micro-OS for orchestrated media systems.

Would you like help writing a blog post to narrate this architecture? Or would you prefer the next layer: GitHub Action CI/CD integration, UI dashboard, or auto-scaling service orchestration?
