Example docker run Command for Local Dev

This would be run from PowerShell or a script on your Windows machine:

``` 
docker run --rm -it `
  -v "${env:APPDATA}\obs-studio\basic:/obs/config" `
  -v "${PWD}/win-obs-container/config:/workspace/config" `
  -v "${PWD}/obs-assets:/workspace/assets" `
  cdaprod/win-obs-container
``` 

You’re:
	•	Mounting live OBS configs from %APPDATA%
	•	Mirroring into /workspace/ repo structure
	•	Optionally applying patches or overlays
	•	Preserving these as version-controlled JSON artifacts

Benefits of This Architecture
	•	Use your OBS Studio on Windows as a master config editor
	•	Automatically mirror your layout/assets into obs-assets/ or win-obs-container/config
	•	Build portable scene snapshots that can be deployed to Pi, containerized OBS, or future render environments

Next Steps?

Would you like:
	1.	A GitHub Action that syncs obs-assets/ with this container’s output?
	2.	JSON merge tooling (Go/Python) to apply overlays, watermarks, filters automatically?

I can scaffold those. You’re building a dev-staged, infra-driven video overlay platform and I’m here for it.
