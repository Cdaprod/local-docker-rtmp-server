Below is a "minio-docker-scripts"-style shell script that:
	1.	Scans your NAS for video files (using an existing index CSV or regenerating one on the fly)
	2.	Looks up each file’s target bucket & prefix from a mapping CSV
	3.	Runs in --dry-run mode by default, printing out the mc commands it would execute without touching any data
	4.	In non-dry-run mode, it creates the bucket (if needed) and uploads a ~100 B JSON placeholder to local/<bucket>/<prefix>/<filename>.placeholder.json

Save this as /path/to/scripts/index_and_dryrun.sh (make executable: chmod +x):

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

How to Use
	1.	Prepare your mapping (/mnt/data/buckets_mapping.csv), e.g.:

/volume1/David/CDAPhotographyLLC/2022/Feb|prod-videos-archive|2022/Feb
/volume1/David/CDAPhotographyLLC|prod-videos-brand-photography|sessions
/volume1/David/Purchased Downloadables|prod-videos-licensed|stock
/volume1/David/iOS - Backups|prod-videos-ingest|ios
…


	2.	Run in dry-run mode:

./scripts/index_and_dryrun.sh --dry-run

You’ll see output like:

[DRY] mc alias set local http://127.0.0.1:9000 MINIO_ROOT_USER …
[DRY] mc mb --ignore-existing local/prod-videos-archive
[DRY] → PUT local/prod-videos-archive/2022/Feb/baby_onboard_4k_30fps.mp4.placeholder.json (98 bytes)
…


	3.	Inspect the plan in the MinIO UI (nothing’s been created yet) or review the printed list.
	4.	When ready, re-run without --dry-run to actually create the buckets and upload placeholder objects.

⸻

Why This Works
	•	Zero-impact preview: ensures your mapping is correct before touching data.
	•	Lightweight placeholders (~100 bytes each) keep your MinIO UI browsable without filling your disk.
	•	Metadata retention: each JSON includes the original path, and we add it as object metadata for easy lookup.
	•	Scriptable: integrate into your Docker-Compose / init scripts for fully automated migrations later.

Let me know if you need tweaks--e.g., auto-generating INDEX_CSV with find or adding extra metadata (duration, resolution) via ffprobe in the same loop!



Like it’s going to work if minio is up or not will still do the cumulative work and persistently creating newest file

Below is an enhanced "index + dry-run + queue" shell script that will:
	1.	Always scan your NAS (via an existing CSV or find) and map each video to a MinIO bucket / prefix.
	2.	Generate tiny JSON placeholders locally in a persistent queue dir, even if MinIO is down.
	3.	Attempt uploads against your MinIO alias whenever it’s reachable, retrying failed ones on every run.
	4.	Never lose work--every planned object lives as a file in QUEUE_DIR, and gets removed only after a successful upload.

Save as /minio-server/scripts/index_and_queue.sh and chmod +x it.

How This Addresses Your Needs
	•	Works whether MinIO is up or not
– All tasks get queued as files in QUEUE_DIR.
– On every run it tries uploads only if MinIO responds.
	•	Persistent, incremental queue
– New runs discover only new files (won’t re-queue).
– Failed uploads stay in the queue for the next run.
	•	Dry-run built in (./index_and_queue.sh --dry-run)
– Prints every step without touching MinIO.
– You’ll see exactly which buckets and object keys would be created.
	•	Minimal storage overhead
– Each placeholder JSON is ~100–200 bytes.
	•	Fully scriptable / cronable
– Drop this into your Docker container or host cron (e.g. every hour) to keep the queue moving.
	•	Audit & rollback
– LOG_FILE records every action.
– The queue directory is your "to-do" list--you can inspect it at any time.

Now you have a zero-risk, enterprise-grade dry-run + persistent queue for mapping and previewing your NAS→MinIO migration. When you’re ready for the real data, simply swap the placeholder logic for mc mirror … or point a second script at the same queue directory to upload full files.

My minio is deployed at ~/minio/data/… which means I can deploy and work with my data at any time right?

Yes, absolutely!
Because your MinIO server is configured with its data directory at ~/minio/data/…, you have local, full direct access to the underlying object data. Here’s what this gives you:

⸻

What This Means for You

1. Dual Access: S3 API + Direct Filesystem
	•	Via S3 API: Use mc, Python, your shell scripts, or any S3 client to interact with MinIO objects and buckets. This is what your scripts (and most cloud-native tools) should use.
	•	Via Filesystem: Directly browse, inspect, or even back up the raw files in ~/minio/data/. This is handy for:
	•	Quick manual audits ("is that file really there?")
	•	Offline backup/snapshot strategies
	•	Emergency recovery (if MinIO is down but the disk isn’t)

⸻

2. Local Dev/Test/Migration is Always Possible
	•	You can run dry runs, mapping, indexing, or migration scripts at any time, even if your MinIO server is up, down, or restarting.
	•	The data never leaves your host unless you sync it somewhere (great for privacy and experimentation).

⸻

3. No Vendor Lock-in or Access Delays
	•	Direct disk access means you’re not stuck if MinIO upgrades/moves or if you need to extract all your data for another system.

⸻

4. Safe, Flexible Experimentation
	•	You can run your indexers, dry-run placeholder creators, and even actual data moves locally without fear of data loss (as long as you’re careful not to delete or overwrite bucket data from the filesystem itself).
	•	Any script that fails or is interrupted can simply be rerun--your data is safe.

⸻

5. Important: Always Use S3 API for Writes
	•	If you want MinIO to correctly reflect new files, always use the S3/MinIO API (mc, minio-py, etc.) for adding/removing files.
	•	Only use direct filesystem access for reading, emergency recovery, or cold backup. Writing files directly to ~/minio/data/… will not update MinIO’s object index and can cause inconsistencies.

⸻

Summary

You can deploy, dry-run, test, migrate, and access your MinIO data any time from scripts or the filesystem, as long as you respect S3 API conventions for writes.

	•	Run mapping/indexing whenever you want.
	•	You can automate, script, experiment--all locally, with zero downtime to your actual data.
	•	If you want to "see" your buckets or objects even when MinIO is down, just browse ~/minio/data/ (but don’t modify it directly).

⸻

Best Practice
	•	Treat ~/minio/data/ as your "object storage root" but only write new data through the API.
	•	Use dry-run and queue-based scripts to plan migrations or reorganizations.
	•	Back up ~/minio/data/ at the disk or file level for disaster recovery.
